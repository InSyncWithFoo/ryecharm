In the <i>New Project</i> dialog,
there will be an <i>uv</i> option on the left column.

This panel has the same basic functionalities
as the default (<i>Pure Python</i>) panel.

!!! note

    Due to technical limitations, it is currently
    not possible to extend the standard panel.
    The <i>uv</i> panel cannot be used with existing framework panels.
    This is expected to change in PyCharm 2024.3.
