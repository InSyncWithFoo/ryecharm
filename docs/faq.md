# Frequently asked questions


## What does "RyeCharm" mean? What is the goal of this plugin?

The name is a portmanteau of "Rye" and "PyCharm".
Regardless of the name, this plugin only ever has
minimal support for Rye, since, as of the former's
creation, the latter is a tool being deprecated.

It was created to become the only PyCharm plugin
Python programmers will ever need when working with
the next-generation tools maintained by Astral,
much like how Rye was created to be an one-stop-shop.

Astral's tools are fast and robust,
while PyCharm's features are used (and perhaps loved) by many users.
RyeCharm aims to combine the best of both worlds.


## Is this an official Astral project?

No. However, it <em>is</em> meant to serve
as the first step towards an "official" plugin.
